The camera is located on the superstructure at the rear of the vessel, providing a view forward. The missile can be seen impacting somewhere forward of cargo hold number four and detonating. Members of the crew can be seen running aft along the port side. The ship is currently at anchor south of Suez, and it is unknown if any of the twenty-four crewmembers were injured. \n The Houthis are a predominantly Shia and Zaidi Islamist political and military movement. The group initially opposed President Saleh, whom they accused of corruption and of ties with Saudi Arabia and the United States. When the 2011 Yemeni Revolution failed to produce a viable coalition government, the Houthis joined with Saleh and took control of the capital. The subsequent Saudi intervention to restore an internationally recognized government ignited an ongoing civil war. The Houthis have deep ties with Hezbollah, and Iran, are funded and supported by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and are widely considered to be an Iranian proxy. Following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, the Houthis began firing missiles (supplied by Iran) at targets in Israel, and at ship\u2019s off Yemen\u2019s Red Sea coast, which they claim is an act of solidarity with Palestinian in the Gaza Strip. The claimed goal is a cessation of combat operations in Gaza and increased access humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip. \n The attack on this Greek-owned vessel is part of an effort to grab world attention by disrupting global trade, MV Zografia is typical of the vessels which transit one of this vital shipping lane. Nearly 190 meters in length and thirty-two meters wide, the Zografia boasts five holds, each of which can carry ten to twelve thousand tons of bulk cargo. Typical cargos carried by this type of vessel include grain, steel products, cement, coal, petroleum coke, and the like. Other ships, container ships such as oil or chemical tankers, or roll-on/roll-off vessels, also transit the Suez Canal and the Red Sea carrying goods between Europe and Asia, accounting for 9 million barrels of oil per day, one third of the world\u2019s container traffic, and twelve percent of global trade goods. \n Though MV Zografia was in ballast (travelling empty), and no cargo was damaged or lost, attacks such as these force shipping companies to alter their routes, thus affecting global trade and the cost of goods and commodities worldwide. The increased risks compel insurance companies to raise rates for ships transiting the Red Sea, and many ship management companies chose not to risk vessels and crews by rerouting around Africa. For example, the passage from Singapore to Antwerp, Belgium, via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal is approximately 15,000 km, while rounding the Cape of Good Hope extends the voyage to almost 22,000 km, as significantly longer and more expensive voyage. This cost is passed along to consumers because their cement, grain, and Play Stations cost significantly more to ship, contributing to the already troublesome issue of inflation. The Houthis claim that they are targeting vessels specifically linked to the U.S. or Israel, but the convoluted nature of international shipping means that a ship might be built in China, owned by a company in Singapore, managed by a company from the UK, crewed by sailors from Ukraine, India, and the Philippines, and hired by a company in Mexico to ship a cargo to a customer in Italy. These attacks are intended to hold the world hostage by disrupting global trade, and action which serves Iran\u2019s foreign policy agenda. \n Messing about with global shipping and maritime trade is a wonderful way to gain the attention of maritime powers and commercial powers, and to draw them into conflict, and the United States is both. Though most students in American schools are taught that taxation without representation caused Americans to rebel against Great Britain, the fact is that British enforcement of the Navigation Acts was equally as responsible for colonial ire, as it disrupted American trade with European colonies in the Caribbean and turned many colonial merchants into smugglers. America\u2019s first foreign war, the Quasi War with France, was partially caused by French interference with American trade, as was the Barbary War and the War of 1812 (partly). Attacks on neutral shipping by Imperial German U-boats during World War I and Nazi U-boats in World War II both served to draw the United States into those conflicts. Interfering with global trade has and will continue to generate responses from the U.S. and its allies, as it should, but there are bound to be unforeseen consequences. Still, world can not be held hostage by Iran and its proxies and therefore must respond, though it will undoubtedly increase existing tensions and lead to greater conflict in the region. And so it goes. \n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nCam\n Cam served as an infantry officer in the Marine Corps, deploying to the Horn of Africa and participating in combat operations in Iraq.

This footage was recorded in February of 2009.\n\nLooking at the situation now, it's easy to think that maybe we wasted our time in Afghanistan. The failures of the Biden administration and top U.S. Military Officials did indeed hand control of the entire nation of Afghanistan back to the 8th century barbarians we spent a majority of our youth fighting. Regardless of the political picture however, it's important to remember that we spent the last twenty years of our lives fighting in Afghanistan to keep insurgent and terrorist organizations from being able to bring the fight back to American civilians here in the United States.\n\nThis footage shows the reality of that conflict. It's taken from the first person perspective of a Soldier on patrol in the Korengal Valley. The mountains are high, the snow is thick, and just looking at the grainy 2009 footage shows you that this patrol was absolutely miserable all the way up to and through the point at which the Taliban ambushed these men from behind, wounding one of them in the opening salvo of gunfire.\n\nRegardless of any of that though, the Soldiers did what Soldiers do best. They reacted with an immediate action drill gaining them fire superiority. They treated their casualty off the X, and then repositioned to continue the firefight from a more tenable position, immediately putting the Taliban on the back foot in their own backyard.\n\nTwenty years of fighting wasn't for nothing, even if our own military leaders and politicians pissed it all away. We proved that in any clime and place where you can take a gun, America and her allies will be victorious on the battlefield. It doesn't matter if the politicians tie our hands behind our backs. It doesn't matter if our top generals have zero moral courage and even less integrity. The battles won are something we can always keep with us, and we won those battles in spite of the handicaps instilled on us by our own leaders.", "view_count": "18273", "created": "1632552835", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/snowy-ambush-in-korengal-valley", "geo": {"region": "Kunar Province", "city": "Korengal Valley", "country": "Afghanistan"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/Korenbal_Winter.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["33.93911", "67.709953"]], "id": "5f260664-7f68-548c-8f1e-689843509f96", "event_date": {"month": "2", "day": null, "year": "2009"}, "author": "Funker530", "title": "Snowy Ambush in Korengal Valley"}, {"geo": {"region": "Republika Srpska", "city": "Mahala", "country": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "118", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/slaxywgemrs41/DASH_720?source=fallback", "width": "1280", "height": "720"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1586869243", "coords": [["44.41103589999999", "18.9452305"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/g153eq/american_peacekeepers_in_the_line_of_fire_as/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "slaxywgemrs41", "event_date": {"month": "8", "day": "29", "year": "1996"}, "author": "TrendWarrior101", "title": "American peacekeepers in the line of fire as Bosnian Serbs and Muslim refugees violently clashes in the village of Mahala, Bosnia (August 29, 1996)"}, {"geo": {"region": "Donetsk Oblast", "city": "Donetsk", "country": "Ukraine"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "66", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/2v0y3dapow8b1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "1280", "height": "720"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1688022244", "coords": [["48.015883", "37.80285"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/14lxwtj/the_ukrainians_hit_another_building_used_by/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "2v0y3dapow8b1", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": "2024"}, "author": "MilesLongthe3rd", "title": "The Ukrainians hit another building used by Russian forces in the outskirts of Donetsk city Geolocation: 48.0610, 37.7731"}, {"geo": {"region": "Donetsk Oblast", "city": "Bakhmut", "country": "Ukraine"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "169", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/uo3xad4ti60b1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "1920", "height": "1080"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1684237126", "coords": [["48.5986674", "37.9980367"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/13j2pcs/video_from_a_ukrainian_soldier_showing_footage_of/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "uo3xad4ti60b1", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": "2024"}, "author": "JustanaverageARG", "title": "video from a Ukrainian soldier showing footage of them moving around in the city of Bakhmut while artillery duel rages on in the background"}, {"geo": {"region": "Zaporizhzhia", "city": "Novoprokopivka", "country": "Ukraine"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "105", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/jw919uauqzqb1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "1280", "height": "720"}, "selftext": "Source: War Monitor ", "created": "1695904525", "coords": [["47.4095573", "35.8398409"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/16ueuve/afu_fighters_work_with_ukrainian_made_uag40/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "jw919uauqzqb1", "event_date": {"month": "9", "day": null, "year": "2023"}, "author": "Hotrico", "title": "AFU fighters work with Ukrainian made UAG-40.

A group known as the Baloch Liberation Army wants more control from the Pakistani Government over the vast natural resources in the region. The fighting here began in 2003, and has only recently been ramping up to a more intense level as the Pakistani Government has been focusing their resources elsewhere.

I highly recommend you go check out Will's write-up on the situation and watch the longer video so you can have a better understanding of the situation and context.

You generally carry these out when you're preparing a larger attack or raid into enemy territory.

These attacks are also done to keep your enemy's morale low, because it lets him know that it doesn't matter where he is on the front-line, someone can take him out at any point in time. By doing this at all times, it also makes it so the enemy combatant commander will struggle to make decisions.

When you're a gunfight, the difference between life and death can often become something as simple as the tire track of a tractor that pulled through the area years prior to you fighting in that field, and here we can see an entire squad of Ukrainians using exactly that to advance on a machine gun position.\n\nThe objective here is to gain a foothold in the Russian trench lines. Once enemy infantry is inside of your trench line, they become notoriously difficult to deal with. That's because, not only are you now fighting the enemy troops inside of your trench, but there are still the enemy troops outside of the trench maneuvering on your position that you need to deal with as well.

At this time the Taliban have not taken responsibility for the war crime which is claimed to have taken place a few days ago, likely due to the fact that they want to appear as a legitimate government. The Afghan military has not acknowledged the existence of the footage either, so very little is known about the situation at this point as a result.\n\nWe have a strict policy at Funker530 of not showing executions or terrorist propaganda, but in this case it seems that this is the opposite of Taliban propaganda. The Taliban are hoping more ANA surrender to ease their push through Afghanistan, and they would like to be taken seriously as a government organization. This footage hurts both of their goals.\n\nThe Taliban would like the ANA to believe that instead of being executed and imprisoned, willing surrender is a \"safe option\", and they will be treated humanely. They are trying to spread this narrative by establishing direct contact with Afghan forces, pledging that if the they surrendered they would be left alive and even given allowances to return to their homelands.\n\nSince the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan earlier this year, the Taliban have gone on a full offensive overrunning positions established by NATO forces and left for the ANA to defend. While some of the ANA continue to hold and take new ground, many units are surrendering and turning over their weapons, vehicles, and equipment to the Taliban.\n\nFor those of us who have worked with the ANA and it's counterparts over the last two decades, it was clear to see that this is what would happen after the final U.S. troops left combat zones in the country, and to see our former brothers in arms treated this way is heart breaking. Our hope is that the release of this video makes more ANA aware of the threat they face, and bring attention globally to the situation our allies now find themselves in.\n\nThe following image was grabbed from 0:12 in the video, which shows a rifle with attachments indicitive of an Afghan SOF unit, including foregrip, IR laser, and ACOG style optic.\n\n\n\nSource of Taliban's \"Safe Surrender\" claims", "view_count": "382271", "created": "1625640922", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/nsfw-leaked-video-shows-taliban-executing-afghan-soldiers-after-surrender", "geo": {"region": "Faryab", "city": "Faryab", "country": "Afghanistan"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/download_87.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["36.0795613", "64.90595499999999"]], "id": "39b195d3-cbe0-5ce3-b584-30f797131a62", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": null}, "author": "jacobpeters81", "title": "(NSFW) Taliban Execute 10 Afghan SOF Troops After Surrender in Leaked Video"}, {"geo": {"region": "Kiev Oblast", "city": "Kyiv", "country": "Ukraine"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "16", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/h7ilrqp9m69c1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "460", "height": "854"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1703833089", "coords": [["50.4503596", "30.5245025"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/18tgxsc/russian_missile_hits_highrise_building_in_kyiv/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "h7ilrqp9m69c1", "event_date": {"year": "2024"}, "author": "Owbe", "title": "Russian missile hits high-rise building in Kyiv"}, {"geo": {"region": "Aleppo", "city": "Aleppo", "country": "Syria"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "17", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/785behmk5hbc1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "1280", "height": "720"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1704832324", "coords": [["36.2021047", "37.1342603"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/192orib/opposition_sniper_successfully_engages_an_saa/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "785behmk5hbc1", "event_date": {"month": "12", "day": "4", "year": "2015"}, "author": "knowyourpast", "title": "Opposition sniper successfully engages an SAA fighter through a window - al-Mashariqa Neighborhood, Aleppo - 12/4/2015"}, {"geo": {"region": "Bryansk Oblast", "city": "Podvytoye", "country": "Russia"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "120", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/qcbido5irhmb1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "1920", "height": "1072"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1693943442", "coords": [["61.52401", "105.318756"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/16ay4jv/russian_volunteer_corps_raided_russian_town_of/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "qcbido5irhmb1", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": "2024"}, "author": "tomina69", "title": "Russian Volunteer Corps raided russian town of Podvytoye in the Bryansk Region recently."}, {"geo": {"region": "Aleppo Governorate", "city": "Kobani", "country": "Syria"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "16", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/tl98psyd615a1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "1280", "height": "720"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1670661435", "coords": [["36.8903434", "38.3500108"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/zhn6kl/turkey_targeting_a_communication_tower_that/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "tl98psyd615a1", "event_date": {"month": "12", "day": "9", "year": "2022"}, "author": "[deleted]", "title": "Turkey targeting a communication tower that provides inernet for residents in eastern countryside of Kobani city in Northern Syria - Dec. 9, 2022."}, {"selftext": "Footage recorded on November 6, 2022 by Kurdish guerrilla fighters near Zakho captures an ATGM attack at the Gir\u00ea Biy\u00ea Turkish Outpost in Northern Iraq.\n\nAccording to the HPG Press Office, guerrillas struck the soldiers at Gir\u00ea Biy\u00ea outpost in the B\u00eagova town of Zakho district at 12:00 on 6 November.

With the technique now exposed to the public, there is no reason not to share its details with everyone.\n\nFirst and foremost, here's the context: the video was captured in Khartoum, Sudan, during recent clashes between the RSF (Rapid Support Forces) and the Sudanese Army. The footage depicts a member of the RSF utilizing a medium machine gun to engage the position of Sudanese troops.\n\nNow for the secret sauce.\n\nApologies in advance to the machine gun community. I understand that publishing this information may lead to disapproval from fellow enthusiasts. However, I believe it is time to disclose our previously guarded technique. It appears that the technique has been exposed, possibly due to the training conducted by U.S. Special Forces in Africa over the past decade. I cannot pinpoint the exact source of the leak, but it seems to be a consequence of their operations.\n\nThis maneuver, commonly referred to as the \"I am become cover\" technique, gained attention when initially observed in a 2014 article by Will Killmore titled \"The Techniques of Mali's Clown Army.\" However, the article presented the technique as a joke and did not delve into its specifics. Subsequently, the widespread adoption and training of the technique throughout Africa, coupled with a failure to effectively control its dissemination alongside our co-authors in the FBI (See: RonnieFit), has resulted in its prominent usage in publicly shared videos across the continent.\n\nThe \"I am become cover\" technique is employed by medium machine gunners to transform themselves into formidable walking walls of suppression, rendering them highly resistant to enemy fire. When executed correctly, the machine gunner assumes the role of a massive barrier, safeguarding the friendly forces positioned behind them. As the medium machine gun unleashes its firepower, it effectively neutralizes incoming rounds, enhancing the protection of the entire unit.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the successful implementation of this technique requires proper execution and coordination within the tactical environment. Additionally, the technique's effectiveness may vary depending on factors such as terrain, enemy tactics, and situational context.\n\nThis technique is also why the U.S. Government wants to ban all weapon systems with a shoulder thing that goes up, as they believe the shoulder thing is what imbues the weapon's rounds with the mystical ability to home in on and obliterate incoming projectiles. What they don't realize however is that it's not the shoulder thing, it's the sheer skill of medium machine gunners alone that make the technique possible.\n\nAlso, all of that was a joke, not a dick, so try not to take it so hard. Have a laugh at this guy who's shooting at (and missing) the broadside of a building about 50 meters away from him. Love you guys, have a good one.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\n Josh Brooks\nJosh is an American writer and former USMC machine gunner with eight years of experience in ground combat arms throughout the GWOT.

The night prior, 1st Squad & 3rd Squad emplaced late in the afternoon and were holding a few compounds in the Southern AO, close to Kajaki Sufla. \n\nAn intense firefight broke out, small-unit maneuver was conducted & a few JDAMS came in to end the engagement. Both squads held firm overnight in their respective compounds til the next morning.\n\n3rd Squad was low on ammo and ordinance after the engagement from the night prior, so 2nd Squad (QRF) comes out in the morning to link with 1st Squad while 3rd Squad retrogrades to resupply and assume QRF for the remainder of the mission.\n\n1st & 2nd squads are now both co-located in the same compound in the green zone, sending out multiple satellite patrols into the AO during the mid day and late afternoon.\n\nRight as the sun sets, the compound is barraged with 73mm rockets and the two conjoined squads take nearly a dozen casualties. Many of which are urgent surgical.\n\nSimultaneously, the Marines of 1st & 2nd squad in the compound begin getting assaulted from numerous locations directly south of the compound, in a complex coordinated attack. The Marines are now repelling the enemy assault and delivering a hellish defense to the gunfire, engaging enemy combatants at less than 100 meters away.\n\nAt this point, the casualties are being loaded onto stretchers in the compound and an LZ is being assigned about 700 meters north, behind the cover of conjoining tree lines. The Marines at the compound still have to repel the assault while stabilizing the casualties, under the cover of nightfall.\n\nBack at FOB Zeebrugge, a contingent of Marines from 3rd squad departs as QRF, sprinting 4 clicks through the IED-laced treelines on foot with radio and firepower support, and are able to make it to the rest of the platoon within 17 minutes of the initial blast.\n\n3rd squad secures the LZ, and is now assisting the transport of the wounded Marines between the compound & LZ, and are treating of the casualties at the the collection point.\n\nThe OP SBF position (video vantage point) has multiple machine guns & a MK19 on the hill surpressing on the enemy and are conducting danger close overhead fires to allow the platoon to safely evacuate the casualities. The platoon on the ground is also coordinating 81mm illum and HE from the ground, until air is confirmed on station.\n\nShortly after, 81\u2019s cease fire & fast movers are on station with payload. The jets identify targets and are dropping ordinance danger close within 150 meters of the compound.\n\nBritish Medevac gets on station after 45 minutes with an escort overhead and makes a daring landing to a hot LZ where the urgent surgicals are loaded onto the bird. The firefight is still ensuing back at the compound 700 meters to the south.\n\nThe bird goes wheels up, and now the focus shifts back to the Marines at the compound who are still actively engaged against a force of 30 estimated Taliban.\n\nWith only remnants of 1st & 2nd squad left on the compound rooftop, the concussed Marines & corpsman grab all the gear they can and begin evacuating the compound. 3rd squad assumes the southern-most position closest to the compound to provide security during the evac, and gathers the rest of the gear from the wounded to haul back to the FOB.\n\nIt takes nearly 3 hours for 3rd squad to conduct the retrograde back to the FOB, bumping & bounding through the green zone while still under fire. Back at the FOB, the remaining priority & immediate casualties are evaluated, treated & evacuated.\n\nDespite the dozen casualties, all Marines & corpsman survived the engagement.

This helmet cam video begins with the conflict in progress, and the police fie at the miners disengage, and retreat. Throughout the first part of the video, it looks as though the camera operator is about to put a bullet in the back of some of his fellow officers. The police fall back, regroup, and then approach the miners again. The miners confront the police, calling them very rude names, and when one of them gets too close to the camera operator, the officer puts a burst into him with his AK. \n Buryatia is a semi-autonomous republic within the Russian federation, located in the far southeast of Russia and sharing a border with Mongolia. The Russian czars began to assert authority over the region in the seventeenth century, and though the indigenous inhabitants attempted to proclaim independence in 1917, they were soon absorbed into the Soviet Union. After the Soviet collapse, Buryatia gain attempted to proclaim independence but was not allowed to secede from the Russian federation, remaining an autonomous republic within the larger Russian federal system, retaining its own president and legislature. In 2004 that autonomy was further curtailed when Vladimir Putin imposed a law that permitted him to appoint the presidents and governors of Russian republics, rather than have them elected by their constituents. \n The incident in the video occurred between Russian police and miners who were accused of mining jade illegally. When police attempted to detain the miners, the latter began throwing jade at the officers and firing shots.

I cannot prove that the Chinese are influencing the Taliban on the ground in Afghanistan in a military training capacity in anyway whatsoever. Everything I write here is simply my own observations from the situation on the ground as it is currently unfolding. Now, that said, I'm going to editorialize at you for a few minutes.\n\nWatching this video, a couple of things are abundantly clear. The Taliban are trying to seem like both a legitimate military force, and a legitimate government at the same time. That's why the Taliban fighters, who ten months ago were hiding in caves and rocking flip flops into battle, are now doing the goose-step in military parades, and why those same Taliban fighters are rocking 3M surgical masks to \"protect\" themselves from COVID-19.\n\nNow, let's think about this logically for a second. The average Taliban fighters doesn't have access to Twitter. Even if he did, the average Taliban fighter can't read or write in any language. On top of this, the average Taliban fighter cut his teeth for war running up and down the sides of mountains lobbing RPGs at heavily armored vehicles. So, how then did these illiterate Taliban fighters figure out that wearing a surgical mask was the appropriate thing to do if they wanted to virtue signal their hopes for an end to the pandemic? More importantly, where did these guys start picking up professional military mannerisms and parade techniques?\n\nObviously, they look like goons regardless of how hard they try. They'll always be 8th Century Barbarians, and no amount of goose-stepping is going to change that. If I had to take one stab at who's teaching them these things, I'd have to point my finger towards China. When the Taliban started to take control of Afghanistan, China was the first country to raise their hand and recognize the Taliban as the true government of Afghanistan. When the Taliban decided it was time to start selling off mining rights to precious minerals in their homeland, China was the first country to raise their hands and put in a bid. I mean, it only makes sense, right?\n\nI might be wearing a tinfoil hat here, and I'm fine with that. Am I the only one seeing the Chinese influence in this video?

I don't think the Taliban like what they had to say.\n\nYou know what, it's been a while since we've seen the Taliban driving around in technical vehicles. You see, the thing about technical vehicles is they make a nice juicy target for airstrikes. They're mostly just unarmored, barely maneuverable pickup trucks with gigantic heavy weapons mounted to the back of them. On top of that gigantic heavy weapon, they're also usually loaded with ammunition, which stresses the vehicle's ability to maneuver over the rough terrain of Afghanistan, and makes them pretty much sitting ducks.\n\nNo surprise here, the Taliban gave away their entire position with the location of this technical and lined themselves up to get absolutely chopped to pieces by the Afghan Airforce. It might be a small air force, and they might be using antiquated fixed and rotary wing assets from the late 90's, but you know what, it's still 2,000% more airpower than the Taliban have, and there really isn't much that they can do about it when the Afghan's stop dropping bombs on them.\n\nThe context in this video is pretty simple. Kandahar has been under siege for the past month or so. Every night around 6pm, all cell-phone service is cut off in the area. By 6:30, most of the civilians inside of the city have returned to their home and the fighting starts. That fighting, generally speaking, runs until a bit after sun-up when the Taliban turn in for the night. Whenever the Taliban try to advance, the Afghan Airforce swoops in to assist the commando and infantry units on the ground who have been holding back the siege for some time.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, the city of Kandahar remains surrounded by Taliban forces. For the Taliban, recapturing the city of Kandahar is of the utmost importance.

According to the source, these vehicles are associated with Wagner PMC, and they are on the M4 highway between Rostov and Moscow. The exact location is known, the identity of the military unit is not verified, and the nature of the explosion is unknown \u2013 it could be an IED, an artillery round, or a rocket strike. The original post asserts that the vehicles are Wagner PMC vehicles on their way to Moscow. \n The last twenty-four hours has witnessed the relationship between Wagner PMC head Yevgeny Prigozhin and the generals atop the Russian Ministry of Defense devolve from sniping on social media to open military conflict. In the past, Putin has been content to let his vassals squabble as long as certain lines were not crossed, but these developments have caused him to directly address the situation, calling the \u201carmed rebellion\u201d a betrayal, and vowing harsh punishment. Events unfolded rapidly and continue to develop, with claims by Prigozhin of Russian military attacks on Wagner forces; Wagner forces purportedly capturing the headquarters of the Russian Southern Military District in Rostov; rumors of Rosgvardiya and Russian Army soldiers refusing to intervene or defecting and joining Wagner units; indications of Chechen Kadyrovite forces moving to interdict Wagner opposition forces; and reports of Wagner opposition forces advancing towards Moscow. The situation is confused and developing rapidly, and social media is flooded with rumor, conjecture, misinformation, wishful thinking, and downright nonsense. Within the cacophony can be found notes of truth. \n In the short term, this could prove hugely beneficial to the Ukrainian army. Rostov on Don lies two hundred kilometers behind the front lines, and, as home of the headquarters for the Southern Military District, is a critical command and control and logistics hub for the Russian Army. This chaos will disrupt the support provided to frontline Russian troops. Additionally, Russian units diverted to interdict Wagner will denude the Russian defensive front of reserves. The Ukrainians will take advantage of this development and attempt to break through Russian lines, and once a breakthrough is achieved, Ukrainian brigades held in reserve can punch through the breach, outflank the Russian defensive lines, and seize operational objectives in the Russian rear. An immediate risk for the Ukrainians is that a desperate Putin, or one of his subordinates, will order sabotage of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. \n The situation is Russia is uncertain. The distance from Rostov to Moscow is about 1,100 kilometers, and it is likely that Wagner opposition forces will be interdicted by Russian air and land forces before reaching their destination, meaning that this revolt might be stamped out in short order. Of course, if the Wagner information campaign is even partly successful, then the defection of Russian units or even a refusal to follow orders could facilitate Wagner efforts. Even if Wagner units reach Moscow, the victory would be purely political as Putin would not be there when they arrive. Any predictions about the future beyond that point go beyond speculation and into the realm of wild guesswork. Two things are certain. First, that Prigozhin is more militant than Putin, and his ascension would not bring peace. Second, a destabilized former superpower with six thousand nukes up for grabs is a scary thought. \n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nCam\n Cam served as an infantry officer in the Marine Corps, deploying to the Horn of Africa and participating in combat operations in Iraq.

This is said by the same group of people who have watched illiterate men in sandals stand up to the U.S. Military for over twenty years with nothing more than their will to fight and decades old Kalishnikov rifles and explosives made from recycled cow manure.\n\n What you're looking at above is all it takes for an insurgent to reek havoc on a professional military.

This is what happens to an armored humvee when it gets hit by an AT missile.\n\nThis video is causing quite the stir in some places on the internet. The reason for the controversy is that back in the day, the United States used to support the Free Syrian Army by providing certain units within the greater Free Syrian Army with arms and equipment, more specifically ATGM systems. The Kurds in Northern Syria are also a faction that are supported by the United States, and pretty much lead the fight against the Islamic State in Northern Syria. Which is where the confusion starts.\n\nAt face value, it would be easy to take this video and say that the U.S. Government is supplying and backing two factions who happen to be killing each other at the rapid rate in Northern Syria. When you dig a bit deeper into the conflict in Syria however, it's pretty clear that the United States stopped support for an overwhelming majority of the Free Syrian Army a long time ago, as the group has since splinted and fractured into dozens of smaller extremist organizations.\n\nEither way, one thing can be said about this video. Extremists in Syria never would have started firing ATGM systems at the cyclic rate if the American Central Intelligence Agency had not made them a viral hit amongst extremist fighters in the region courtesy of individuals like Abu TOW and the 13th Coastal Division who were forced to publish every single TOW strike directly to YouTube in order to get their resupplies.", "view_count": "17840", "created": "1636440764", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/nsfw-kurds-abandon-humvee-after-atgm-strike-in-northern-syria", "geo": {"region": "Aleppo Governorate", "city": "Northern Syria", "country": "Syria"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/ATGM_North_Syria.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["34.80207499999999", "38.996815"]], "id": "87a31d33-5b2c-5dd8-982a-679c360229cd", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": null}, "author": "Funker530", "title": "(NSFW) Kurds Abandon Humvee After ATGM Strike in Northern Syria"}, {"geo": {"region": "Nineveh", "city": "Mosul", "country": "Iraq"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "39", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/657he8v78uac1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "720", "height": "720"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1704554708", "coords": [["36.3489278", "43.157736"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1902aw0/iraqi_abrams_tank_from_the_9th_armored_division/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "657he8v78uac1", "event_date": {"month": "7", "day": "14", "year": "2017"}, "author": "0001_10_22", "title": "Iraqi Abrams tank from the 9th armored division takes out several IS fighters during a night operation in near the old city of Mosul,2017-7-14."}, {"selftext": "Footage released by the YPG Press Office captures the moment several Islamic State prison escapees get caught out in the open near the Hasakah Prison in Syria.\n\nIt's been several days now since the Haskah Prison riots happened, which saw a solid number of Islamic State fighters escaping into the surrounding area.

For a professional military, this will often look like a hardened location that's safe from enemy fire where a medic or several medics are positioned to conduct initial trauma care for wounded Soldiers. Following this location, troops are usually transported to a nearby field medical hospital where they can receive extended medical treatment, like surgeries, before they are sent to a professional care facility where they can start to recover.\n\nIn the case of the Syrian Arab Army however, this is not so. The Syrian Arab Army, for those not in the loop, is an army primarily built from under-trained and poorly equipped conscripts. For these guys, a casualty collection point is where you bring your wounded before trying to get them into a truck that will take them to the nearest hospital. Medical treatment looks like who can shove something onto this wound to slow the bleeding and the safety of the location is also very much in question.

This footage was recorded a week ago.\n\nInghimasi fighters from Hay\u02bcat Tahrir al-Sham, better known as HTS, conduct a break-neck raid against a position in Western Aleppo that was being held by the Syrian Arab Army. According to HTS, six regime Soldiers were killed during the attack along with two HTS guerilla fighters. The exact date of this assault is unknown, but it is the seventh attack of this scale conducted by HTS in the region since the beginning of 2023, marking a resurgence of violent combat in the brutal decade long Syrian Civil War.\n\nWhile it's currently easy to overlook wars that are happening around the world in favor of watching the unfolding situation in Ukraine, our mission at Funker530 is to always maintain a holistic look at war everywhere. The situation in Syria is currently able to rapidly decline due to the lack of Russian ground troop presence in Syria. It was through direct Russian aid and intervention that the Assad regime was able to finally begin putting a lid on the Syrian Civil War. That leverage has quickly deteriorated as Russia has had to focus more attention on their efforts and objectives in Ukraine.\n\nOn top of this degradation of Russian capabilities, Syria has hurt their own combat power throughout the country in favor of assisting Russian forces with rear-echelon security work during their war with Ukraine. As of this writing, somewhere between 500 and 5,000 Syrian troops are deployed to rear-echelon positions in places like DPR and LPR where they're working in a mostly non-combatant capacity. While that may not seem like a large number, it is likely that the Assad regime sent their best troops to conduct this work in order to represent themselves in a better light to their allies.\n\nFor those of you who are out of the loop on who Hay\u02bcat Ta\u1e25r\u012br a\u0161-\u0160\u0101m is, they're a Sunni Islamist organization formed from the groups Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the Ansar al-Din Front, Jaysh al-Sunna, Liwa al-Haqq and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement. You may recognize them more from the group's acronym which is simply HTS. The merged group is currently led by Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and former Ahrar al-Sham leaders with a spattering of other group's leaders currently sitting on the organizations high command. Their objective is ousting the Assad regime and its Hezbollah partners from Syrian territories and they want to form an entirely Islamic government. This is also one of the only groups not currently supported by any entity who has a vested interest in the long-term Syrian Civil War.\n\nThe world stage is deeply entangled. A conflict in one part of the planet often directly impacts conflicts happening elsewhere in the world. For that reason, it's important to always keep your eyes open and watching everything that is happening. We're just one source of this information. We've also heavily documented the war in Syria over the past decade and you can easily access that information by hitting the search bar up top.\n\nStay informed. Further escalation in places like Syrian and Afghanistan can create power vacuums that impact the entire world on a massive scale. These places and vacuums are often all that is required for groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State to stage large scale terror attacks that could further destabilize the entire world.", "view_count": "54093", "created": "1674370078", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/nsfw-brutal-raid-on-syrian-army-position-in-western-aleppo", "geo": {"region": "Aleppo", "city": "Aleppo", "country": "Syria"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/HTS_qQdWWCw.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["36.2021047", "37.1342603"]], "id": "46ee316c-3959-5b41-87f4-8669a9e3fce8", "event_date": {"month": "10", "day": "10", "year": "2024"}, "author": "salamandersandals", "title": "(NSFW) Brutal Raid on Syrian Army Position in Western Aleppo"}, {"geo": {"region": "Southern District", "city": "Ashdod", "country": "Israel"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "64", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/448ikq65fcg91/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "264", "height": "480"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1659900714", "coords": [["31.804381", "34.655314"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/winxmy/iron_dome_interceptions_of_missiles_from_gaza/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "448ikq65fcg91", "event_date": {"geographic": null, "month": "8", "day": "7", "year": "2022"}, "author": "Hamozim", "title": "Iron dome interceptions of missiles from gaza above the city of Ashdod, Isreal [07/08/22]"}, {"selftext": "US Central Command (CENTCOM) acknowledged an \"over-the-horizon\" drone strike on a vehicle that was suspected of being a, ISKP vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) destined for the Kabul airport. \n\nCENTCOM claimed confidence in the strike was a secondary explosion (the detonation of the explosive device) was observed as a result of the strike.

They're in the middle of a gunfight with the Islamic State, and both guys are so confident that they've decided now is the time to shoot some dank war porn for their TikTok channels.

His intentions are clearly to shoot his camera directly at the Islamic State so that he can later toss on his favorite Nasheed and make fun of the Islamic State. While filming from the side of the up-armored high-back, he encounters his first near miss and decides it's time to stop filming. Guy B captures all of this on his camera perfectly from the safety of his vehicle.\n\nA few seconds later, Guy A decides to get up from the back of the vehicle and walk around. He's probably in the mood for a Miami after his first near miss. As he's moving, a second round impacts with the glass of the Guy B's vehicle absolutely splattering the hell out of the ballistic protection it provides him. Had that glass not been ballistic in nature, he probably would have died. That shot also just happened to narrowly miss Guy A, which makes this video even more lucky.\n\nFor the rest of their lives, Guy A and Guy B here will be talking about this moment. What's even better is that they have videographic evidence of the firefight to prove that they're not just telling a tall tale.

The full context of this video is unknown, but it's a moment of random and sudden violence that just stands out in the sea of violence that the world is seeing today.\n\nIt's pretty easy to take life in the United States for granted sometimes. Very few wars have happened in our country, and to date we've been entirely untouched by modern warfare because of a thing known as American Hegemony. If you're unsure of what that means, a quick Google search will give you all of the answers you need, but the TL;DR is that the United States projects power so far and in such a vast amount that most countries could never hope to start a shooting war with us because we could invade them in their home country in a matter of hours.\n\nThis safety net, and the logistical difficulty of fighting a war in the United States, has kept us safe from a world like this for almost a century now, with the last attack on our country from a Nation-State occurring by Japanese forces in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska during World War 2. Currently, the only way to successfully attack the United States is through random and sporadic acts of terrorism. Think 9/11, the Boston Marathon Bombing, or the Pulse Nightclub Shooting in 2016. We live this relatively secure lifestyle because of one thing, and one thing only, and that is the power projection of the United States Military around the world.\n\nWithout that power projection, and our own preemptive actions and posturing to let other nations know that we're ready to respond swiftly and decisively, the United States becomes more susceptible to attacks from conventional military forces. At the core of this power projection is the United States Navy, which requested the decommissioning of 39 warships in 2023 while only adding 9 new warships to their operating fleet. It's essential to note that this decline in naval power is occurring simultaneously with a recruiting crisis within the United States Military, while our adversaries on the world stage are growing bolder in taking military actions within their sphere of influence without fearing reprisals from the EU or the United States.\n\nBasically, we live in a very fragile world. You haven't seen a single American recording an artillery strike landing on their block in Detroit, Michigan or Washington D.C. because American Hegemony keeps our enemies rooted in place unable to act without the fear of an immediate and deadly response from the world's only true military super power. Unfortunately, the average American's confidence in the United States Military is waning due to poor senior leadership, poorly spent and managed budgets, and the failures caused in Operation Enduring Freedom by the two previously mentioned items. This, in turn, emboldens our adversaries and allows them to take actions they otherwise never would have considered. It also raises doubt in our allies, who heavily rely on U.S. forces for their own safety and security.\n\nDoes this mean that we'll see an attack on the United States in the immediate future from a near-peer foe like China or Russia? Probably not. Does it increase the likelihood of another global war breaking out in both Europe and the Pacific? Yes. Does it also increase the likelihood we'll see future terror attacks in the lower 48 of the United States caused by emboldened Islamic Extremists backed by countries like Iran? Most definitely it does. Could that lead to an eventual collapse of the world we live in today? It's a definite possibility.\n\nI don't like to fear monger with my writing. Some in the comments may disagree, and that's fine. I'm thankful that we live in a world where random artillery shells impacting street corners and interrupting my afternoon jog isn't a regular occurrence. I'm thankful that I live in a nation where I can write whatever the hell I want in our blog, and you guys can read it and respond however you want without fear. In order to be thankful for that, I have to first understand that we have peace here because brush-fire conflicts like the one in Sudan and small scale wars (relatively speaking compared to a global war) like the one in Ukraine are isolated to their specific regions because our adversaries still fear what the United States can and will do in response to an escalation.\n\nI hope it stays that way for another thousand years, and along the way we can return to a better state of global security as a result. To the six of you who actually read this, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\n Josh Brooks\nJosh is an American writer and former USMC machine gunner with eight years of experience in ground combat arms throughout the GWOT.

If true, it is believed that follow-on targets for the Rapid Support Forces would be Ad Douiem and Abu Hibeira, however it is currently not believed that the RSF has the logistical capacity to conduct such operations at this time.\n\nOne of the larger fears is that the RSF could utilize the Dam as a weapon to flood Khartoum.

While the NRF, or National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, has been around for a minute, the group has only just now started to catch the attention of the people of Afghanistan and the rest of the world. Throughout the country, young Afghan men have started putting out videos of them swearing their allegiance to the NRF's movement. One group has even stated that they will start conducting guerilla style attacks against the Taliban in Kabul.\n\nSince some of you are probably just learning about the NRF for the first time in this article, let me take a minute to explain who and what they are. The NRF is a group of anti-Taliban fighters comprised of Northern Alliance, Afghan Commandos, and other anti-Islamic Extremist groups who do not recognize the rule of the Taliban. Their objective is to eventually overthrow the Taliban, and reinstate the Afghan government that was built under ISAF occupation. The NRF is led by Ahmad Massoud, son of Ahmad Shah Massoud or the \u201cLion of Panjshir,\u201d as many know him.\n\nIn this video, what you're looking at is an NRF fighter watching as Taliban fighters swarm around a vehicle that rolled over in an ambush against the Taliban in the Panjshir Valley. According to reports coming out of the region, the Security Commander for the region was seriously injured in the ambush, and his body guard was killed. Footage of the actual ambush has yet to be released by the NRF, but due to their current location we believe it may be difficult for them to get their message out to the rest of the world.\n\nWhile this video is short, it is more evidence that the NRF is indeed starting to revolt against Taliban rule.

The Karenni tribes, in various factions, have clashed with government forces many times since the 1950s, when the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) began fighting for an independent state. This has welled over into the current violence in the region, with the Karenni Army becoming a major anti-junta force.\n\n Starting at 0:10 seconds we see the Karen forces firing on the government troops in a depiction that is fairly typical of combat footage in this conflict. At 0:18, a clear view of the rocky, mountainous Kayah terrain gives an indication of what combat in this area must be like.

A simultaneous airstrike is called in which accidentally drops a 500 pound bomb on a U.S. Army infantry outpost, mistaking the position for Taliban fighters.\n\nLuckily there were no friendly casualties in this incident. It is still unclear what caused the pilot to target the wrong position, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and assume the fire support officer got his friendly/target grids switched when he sent them to the pilots.\n\nINTERVIEW:\n\nQ: What events led up to this bomb drop, and what was going through your mind after the bomb hit?\n\nA: We had been taking harassing sniper fire for a little over a month and could not find out where this guy was, so we were up in the OP, took a few rounds and battalion heard we were in a TIC. Then about a minute prior to being cleared hot we heard they were in route. We heard weapons free, they told us to get small, and I replied with \u201cYeah, I get small\u201d sarcastically, and then it landed about 15m behind us.\n\nHonestly we had dropped so many bombs up to that point that the thought never even crossed my mind that this could even happen, especially with all the checks put into place. About a half second before impact you could hear the bomb screaming in like I hadn\u2019t ever heard before, and I definitely knew at that point something was off. After the initial realization that it had hit behind us, we were so scatter brained trying to figure out what happened. It hit so close to the guys in the tower it actually knocked the fill out of radios.\n\nThen we went up to check on the rest of the boys. Luckily our First Sergeant called up and put everyone on stand to, inadvertently saving the lives of at least 3 soldiers who would have been in the bay that had shrapnel sent through every inch of it including shearing holes into weapons. Once the smoke had cleared and we realized that no one was seriously injured, we were just sitting there in awe as the anger started to build.\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been for the decision of the First Sergeant to bring everyone to \u201cstand to\u201d, three of our guys would have died in that wood building. His decision saved three of our men.", "view_count": "33696", "created": "1588143357", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/500-pound-bomb-mistake", "geo": {"region": "Paktika Province", "city": "FOB Tillman", "country": "Afghanistan"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/bomb-oops.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["33.93911", "67.709953"]], "id": "800f6654-9286-50ea-b0fc-0f2943486b62", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": null}, "author": "Funker530", "title": "500 Pound Bomb Dropped on US Soldiers By Mistake"}, {"geo": {"region": "Sagaing", "city": "Pale", "country": "Myanmar"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "138", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/c0u1xzwsp4ea1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "276", "height": "480"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1674626274", "coords": [["21.9337741", "94.8779969"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/10krlgi/antijunta_forces_firing_homemade_mortars_toward/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "c0u1xzwsp4ea1", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": null}, "author": "thekingminn", "title": "Anti-Junta Forces firing homemade mortars toward Myanmar Army positions near the Town of Pale, Sagaing Region."}, {"selftext": "This footage depicts forces opposed to the military junta in Myanmar ambushing an Army boat on the Ayeyarwaddy River near Myingyan, Mandalay. \n\n The footage begins with a People\u2019s Defense Force (PDF) machine gunner, using an RPK-type machine gun with a drum magazine in a depressed or dug-in position.

This video is the sniper's view of that impact on an urban battle-space.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\n Josh Brooks\nJosh is an American writer and former USMC machine gunner with eight years of experience in ground combat arms throughout the GWOT.

All of the camera work in this video exists because guys like Staff Sergeant Lee have the privilege and skills of keeping up with these guys while they're out in the field working.\n\nIt's important to remember that while wars are occurring around the world without the direct involvement of American ground troops, that does not mean that American ground troops are not out in the field preparing to step in on behalf of the United States on a moment's notice.\n\nIt is all too easy to look at the conflict in Ukraine through a jaded lens and assume that the involvement of the United States would do nothing to change the picture. After all, Ukrainian ground forces are armed to the teeth with American equipment and there's even a good number of former American veterans on the ground operating in a combat capacity in support of Ukraine. Still, both sides are locked in a deadly stalemate that has devolved into trench warfare due to neither side being able to adapt to emergent battlefield technologies.\n\nRegardless of that stalemate between Ukraine and Russia, everyone everywhere should realize that if America flexes its military power, the world will have to stop and bear witness to it. The United States waged two separate and simultaneous wars for twenty years between Iraq and Afghanistan, and never once had to stop and reinforce either conflict with a mandatory mobilization of conscripted troops.\n\nWe kept that same pace for twenty years while holding annual peace time training operations in AFRICOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, PACOM, NORTHCOM, and SOUTHCOM, while simultaneously holding a combatant command force in readiness in every single one of these areas of operations. No other military in the history of the world has rivaled current American Hegemony, and it's unlikely that any number of nations including China and Russia could stand against it. When you also take into consideration our 29 other NATO allies who would also immediately be involved in any conflict that we were dragged into, there's simply no question of \"who would win.\" \n\n\"But, America lost in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" Strategically, yes. Our country lost the stomach for those conflicts and our General Officer Corps tied the hand of the American warfighter preventing them from doing what needed to be done to achieve mission success. Tactically, America won every battle and operation they fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In a conventional war where the rules and objectives are clear, we're looking at a fairly different story, see the first three weeks of the invasion of Iraq as an example.\n\nIs the American military perfect? Not by any means. Is there a single nation on the world that could withstand the combat power of a Carrier Strike Group supported by a Marine Expeditionary Unit? Not even slightly. That's not even factoring in the fact that the four strongest air forces in the world are the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the U.S. Army. America doesn't brag about their fifth gen fighter jets, we use them to randomly shoot down cheap Chinese spy balloons with $200,000 missiles because we can and we think it's funny.\n\nSo go ahead down in the comments Russian trolls. Suck on that Copium as hard as you can. It doesn't change the fact that your military is getting beaten by the DRMO pit scraps the United States and NATO gave Ukraine to prevent Russia from having success in their \"Special Military Operation.\" China is more than welcome to FAFO too, the Chinese human wave attack has been every American machine gunner's private wet dream since the Korean War.\n\nI hope everyone enjoys this video of cool guys doing cool guy shit.

A recent video release by the Pakistan separatist group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) reportedly documents a deadly raid against a Pakistan Frontier Corps outpost in Marwaar, in the vicinity of the Bolan Pass in Baluchistan province on May 31, 2021. \n\nThe released footage is just under an hour long, and it is broken down into two parts. The second part picks up immediately following the end of part one, and we have published them in separate blogs under the same name. \n\nAnalysis: The footage itself is impressive in scale, as it was filmed from multiple angles, including some body-worn imagery. The Pakistani Frontier Corps troops, specifically of the Ghazaband Scouts, were the unit occupying/defending the base when the Baloch rebels attacked. It's unclear from the footage how long the attack lasted, but by the end of the video night has fallen. Also note that at no point does any Pakistan aircraft or artillery come to the aid of their besieged troops. \n\nThe BLA gets their observation points set up and then infiltrate the outer perimeter with only a few militants, at first, to avoid detection. They initiate their attack with a coordinated burst of automatic small arms fire on a group of exposed Pakistani troops. The surprised soldiers rapidly scramble to fighting positions and barracks areas to retrieve their weapons. The BLA continues suppressing the government fighters to allow more insurgents to move up to the perimeter. \n\nAt this point, extremely close-range exchanges of deadly fire erupt. Casualties are taken by both sides. BLA fighters marked with red stars, identified by their Alias, ultimately die in the battle and their moment of death is emphasized with forlorn music. Three BLA fighters were killed in the incident, and the BLA claims to have killed 24 Ghazaband Scouts, a number we haven't confirmed. The first BLA attacker to die is shot from just inches away, as both him and his foe are visible, firing at each other from opposite sides of the same wall.\n\nAn incredible moment is also filmed as a BLA fighter throws a grenade over the wall and a Pakistani soldier can be seen picking it up to throw it back, but it explodes in his hand, likely killing him instantly. \n\nAnother thing to take note of is the weapons used by the BLA. This video shows some use of American weapons, including the M16 and an M249 SAW. They also use several RPG warheads, while in previous releases, they tend to ration RPG expenditure. This diversity and increase in firepower is likely linked to the collapse of the Afghan National Army in neighboring Afghanistan, where local markets are flooded with cheap military weapons and equipment abandoned or captured from government units. \n\nAs the BLA encroach from multiple angles, the threat of fratricide is greatly increased. The radios are in a constant state of chatter, as team leaders on the ground try to coordinate maneuvers without killing each other. Eventually, all the Pakistan troops that were willing to defend the base are killed and the rest retreat to hardened buildings at the interior of the outpost and lock themselves in. \n\nThe BLA now assigns some of their fighters to looting duty in the already-cleared fortifications. They take high-value weapons and equipment and consolidate it at the edge of the perimeter while another group is tasked with taking the loot away and returning with resupplies. Based on the visible manpower, this appears to be one of the largest offensive operations ever executed by any of the Baluchistan separatist groups.\n\nAs the sun begins to fall, the last few surviving Ghazaband Scouts are holed up in a bunker with their backs to the wall and rifles out. The BLA recognizes the danger in this and unleashes their plethora of rocket propelled grenades into the fortifications, hammering them into submission. The raid ends with the BLA's calling card torching of the objective. \n\nThe video release is concluded with a tribute to the three fallen fighters and a displaying/questioning of a Pakistani soldier they captured in the battle. \n\nThe various Baluchistan insurgent groups are fighting for independence from Pakistan as they claim the Pakistan government offers their ethnic group no representation within the government, while extracting resources from their mineral-rich province and selling out their ancestral lands to Chinese investors.\n\nRegardless of BLA's perceived virtue behind their struggle, and Pakistan's continued support of actual terrorism, in 2019 the US State Department designated the BLA as a Foreign Terror Organization while trying to improve relations with Pakistan and China.", "view_count": "65998", "created": "1628405696", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/nsfw-extreme-close-quarters-battle-at-pakistan-outpost-part-2", "geo": {"region": "Balochistan", "city": "Marwaar", "country": "Pakistan"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/marwaar_3.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["30.375321", "69.34511599999999"]], "id": "37886d4e-c380-5dcb-827f-c9ff340e0a74", "event_date": {"month": "5", "day": "31", "year": "2021"}, "author": "Funker530", "title": "(NSFW) Extreme Close Quarters Battle At Pakistan Outpost (Part 2)"}, {"selftext": "Taliban fighters in the Baghdis Province of Afghanistan utilize a captured humvee as a suicide vehicle in the middle of an attack against an Afghan National Army outpost, in March of 2020.

If you're part of the uninitiated and you don't know what Charge Zero means, let me break it down Barney style. Every mortar round has a set amount of charges on it. These charges add extra burn to the round as it exits the tube, adding additional range to the round as it clears the tube.\n\nCharge Zero, as mentioned in this video, refers to all of the extra charges being removed from the base of the mortar round because of the short distance to the target. You can see the number two removing the charges from the base of the round before handing it to the number one. The rounds are then fired into a nearby tree line where the Taliban fighters are at.\n\nIt's also worth noting the small adjustments being given to the mortarman launching the rounds. This is a testament to his gunnery skills, as firing from the handheld position is a bit of an art form that has to be learned over time. An adjustment of drop 50 is given to the gunner, letting him know that he needs to adjust the mortar tube's aim by 50 mils to get the rounds impacting closer to the target.

The group was originally formed in 2016 during the peak of the Syrian Civil War when the Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, the Islamic Muthanna Movement, and the Army of Jihad merged into one organization. The strange thing about this footage is that it was released in January of 2023, and claims state that it was filmed on December 11, 2022, which is four years after the group was defeated and dismantled by the Syrian Government in 2018. \n\nSince their defeat in 2018, this organization has only existed in small numbers. Throughout 2019 they were responsible for two attacks in which they killed a rival terrorist group's leader and two Russian Soldiers. They also released photos of the deceased ISIS leader Abu Bark al-Baghdadi in that same year and swore allegiance to the group's new leader at the time, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurash.\n\nIf this video is as recent as it claims, this would mark the first time that the group has conducted any significant combat action since their defeat in 2018, which is not a good sign for the future of the conflict in Syria.

The Kurdish Workers Party, abbreviated PKK, has been waging an insurgency against Turkish forces since 1986. Current instability in the region has allowed the PKK faction to continue and expand their operations, as demonstrated here. At 03:41 we see as many as seven Turkish soldiers in a group; although the video implies that all seven were killed, the two in the back appear to be unharmed. The PKK fighters are also shown firing and throwing grenades into dug-in positions. Although the thermal scope\u2019s recording of the fighting appears to show inaccurate fire in many cases, in some cases Turkish troops are shown falling or otherwise confirmed.

It shows a strike package being carried out against an Islamic State fighting position on August 24, 2022. We're using this footage to report on the fact that four American service members and one military working dog were wounded by an explosion during a joint raid against a compound of Islamic State fighters where prominent Islamic State leader Hamza al-Homsi was suspected of being at.\n\nAll five of the wounded are currently being treated for their injuries at an aid station in Iraq. No other SDF or other American forces were wounded in the raid, and no Islamic State fighters were located at the booby trapped compound. An ISIS assassination cell leader was killed in a similar raid at another target location in the region that same night, however no video or photographic evidence of the raid has been released yet.\n\nIt's important that we discuss topics like this. The general reaction I've seen to this type of news lately has been one of complete surprise. For some reason, Americans are under the impression that there are no American troops currently forward deployed conducting kinetic combat operations anywhere in the world. There seems to be a complete lack of understanding in the fact that we have troops forward deployed and actively supporting combat operations in Syria, Iraq, and the entire Horn of Africa. We may have pulled out of Afghanistan, but that does not mean that American troops are not still forward deployed.\n\nIf more video or photographic evidence of this raid is released, we'll be sure to update everyone with a new post. CENTCOM and the Department of Defense are obligated to release this footage through public domain channels as long as the footage is not sensitive or capable of compromising on-going operations. As they're already openly talking about this raid, I would suspect we should be seeing some form of redacted drone video released in the near future.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\n Josh Brooks\nJosh is an American writer and former USMC machine gunner with eight years of experience in ground combat arms throughout the GWOT.

As the footage begins, the Kurds clearly have reasonable suspicion against the ISIS fighters, as they maintain a significant amount of distance and hold their hardcover positions. \n\nWithout understanding dialect spoken in the situation, we can hear the tone becoming more intense as the two groups begin screaming back and forth with each other. A few moments later, the Kurdish troops begin firing on at least four of the ISIS fighters, seemingly neutralizing them. Seconds later, two explosions occur as two of the fighters were armed with suicide vests. It is unclear whether these vests were detonated from a distant bystander, or detonated as a last ditch effort from the dying fighters themselves. \n\nA few months back, March of 2021, another journalist at Funker530 shared similar footage, but it is unconfirmed to be the same incident. I'll leave it to you in the comments below to give your thoughts and analysis.\n\nThe conflict between these two groups goes back to 2013, when the Kurds and ISIS clashed with one another after the Islamic State (IS) honed its sights in on three Kurdish enclaves which bordered their territory in northern Syria. These attacks from the Islamic State carried on until mid-2014, when the YPG repelled them, gaining a foothold against the Islamic State. Following the Kurds involvement in the repelling of the Islamic State in late 2014, IS launched a surprise attack on Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq. As a result, many Kurd inhabited cities, such as Sinjar, fell to the IS, resulting in the killing and capturing of thousands of religious minorities.\n\nLeading into the mid to late 2010's, these conflicts continued between the two groups. As a result, many allied forces such as the United States and other world powers became majorly involved in the conflicts, as they provided aerial support and airstrikes to further combat the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq. \n\nNo One Left Behind is the first and premier national non-profit dedicated exclusively to standing with our wartime allies (those applying for or who have received a Special Immigrant Visa).", "view_count": "137574", "created": "1630911261", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/nsfw-isis-unit-fake-surrender-and-detonate-suicide-vests-near-kurd-positions", "geo": {"region": "Hasakah", "city": "Hasakah", "country": "Syria"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/original_images/kurds.PNG", "coords": [["36.507867", "40.7462671"]], "id": "cbbf905e-2d23-5b7c-a9c1-b4bc02876951", "event_date": {"month": "5", "day": "1", "year": "2017"}, "author": "Funker530", "title": "(NSFW) ISIS Unit Fake Surrender And Detonate Suicide Vests Near Kurd Positions"}, {"selftext": "Members of the Taliban mount a daring daytime RPG strike against an American position in Yahya Kheyl Afghanistan.

The first time I ever saw this footage was way back in 2016, and I distinctly remember having a conversation about how odd it was that the Free Syrian Army was posting footage of their victories from the future. A future where they apparently have MRAPs and are absolutely steam rolling the Syrian Arab Army at every single turn.\n\nYou see, here's the thing about both factions in the Syrian Civil War. At the time, both sides wanted to look like they were winning. What this meant for the Syrian Arab Army was they would drop artillery and barrel bombs all over the place at random, and the Syrian Ministry of Defense would release the sanitized footage to make it look like they were dominating their opposition. The Free Syrian Army on the other hand wasn't tied to any of the same sanitation procedures, so the footage that came from them always seemed more brutal, kind of like the footage in this video.\n\nFor them, there was no command and control in the release of footage from their perspective in combat. It was often recorded by individuals on the battlefield using cell-phones, GoPros, DJI drones, and handheld camera systems. Then, it would be released through dodgy channels that would get it onto the internet in anyway that they could, which is generally when we would find it, verify it, and then release it as a way to document the war in real-time.\n\nThat leads us into what you're seeing here. This was a particularly brutal assault that the FSA conducted in the al-Tamanah sub-district of Idlib in Northwestern Syria. The purpose of the attack was to push Syrian Arab Army troops out of the region in one swift movement so that the Free Syrian Army could better control the area. The results of that assault are obvious because of this video.\n\nThe Syrian Arab Army, comprised mostly of young conscripts, lost the will to fight mid-assault and tried to conduct an uncoordinated retreat. The result? Some of them got hit by an MRAP, a bunch of more of them ended up getting killed by machine gun fire.\n\nUnfortunately, that's just how war works.

For years though, we've known about the threat of drone dropped munitions on the battlefield. This threat first emerged on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria during the reign of the Islamic State, who weaponized drones to great effect against both the Iraqi military and all factions who opposed them in Syria.\n\nThe Ukrainians also quickly adopted this method of conducting warfare, only it was far more widespread due to their ease of access to commercial drones and 3D printing systems that enabled them to alter the devices to carry and drop even heavier loads.\n\nThe DoD in the United States has been quietly working on a solution to this problem for almost a decade now, but it doesn't appear that they've come up with much of a solution. The current through process is indoctrinated in C-IED warfare, with companies making electronic counter-measures that fire out a cone of jamming signals that need to be consistently aimed at the moving device.

On every single level of leadership past the field grade, we failed in Afghanistan. As civilians fell to their death trying to cling onto the side of aircraft leaving Afghanistan, Company Commanders, Platoon Commanders, Staff Non-Commissioned Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Junior Enlisted Warfighters were all forced to not act and simply watch.\n\nWhen they returned home, they got to sit and watch again as those same senior leaders who failed them at the strategic level wrote themselves Bronze Stars and Silver Stars for their continued failure to decisively win a single strategic engagement against America's enemies. How you write yourself an award for failing in every facet of your job is beyond me, but here we are with the same Generals who failed in Afghanistan being promoted up the chain of command even further. In fact, the only Commissioned Officer who was punished for the dramatic failure in Afghanistan was the Officer who had the balls to raise his hand and throw his rank on the table calling out his own senior leaders.\n\nThe war in Afghanistan ended the exact same way it began, with human beings falling to their deaths trying to escape an inevitable fate. For the troops and leaders at the tactical level, there was never once a direct failure to complete the mission set in front of them even when they were faced with impossible odds. From the Horse Soldiers who broke the Taliban in 2001 to the Marines who pacified a majority of the Helmand Province, every mission fought on the ground and in the air was an astounding success, but still we saw senior leaders try to shuck the failures of their own strategic command down to lower echelons, like it was the Captains and Lieutenants failing to accomplish the impossible tactical objectives set before them.\n\nDon't worry though, the senior commanders secured their bags up at the Pentagon. Afghanistan was just another stepping stone forward on their path to a six figure retirement, contract gig, and book deal. It was another notch in the belt. Another Mission Accomplished, moment in the Global War on Terror. One more gold star to pin on the long list of Bronze and Silver Stars they wrote themselves for looking at maps and hosting meetings with civilian contractors in air conditioned trailers on rear echelon air bases where the largest threat was Starbucks running out of Caramel for their macchiato.\n\nAlmost a year later, and still not a single Politician or General Officer has stepped up and taken accountability for the failures in Afghanistan. Not a single person has been punished for the deaths of U.S. Service Members who were forced to form a picket in an impossible to secure situation. Not a single star-collared uniform has sat in a trial under the UCMJ for the death of 10 civilians when an errant drone strike was fired off to facilitate a \"feel good moment\" for Americans watching the fall of Afghanistan live on their own television sets. There has been zero accountability for the mistakes made on the withdrawal for Afghansitan outside of Marine LT. Col Scheller's court-martial hearing. All he did was speak the truth.\n\nIn fact, I bet this post gets less than 10,000 views on our webpage, because quite frankly Americans have already forgotten that Afghanistan happened. Right now, the only thing on the minds of a majority of America is inflation, gas prices, and the debate on if abortion should be a state's rights issue or not. The memory span of the average American has apparently fallen short, even when compared with a gold fish.\n\nRegardless, I'm still here, and as long as I have access to the internet and a keyboard, I will continue to write about this failure. Our readers and real family are here as well on this platform, and I know you guys won't stop being silent on this issue either. We will continue to raise Hell about the current situation on the ground in Afghanistan, because we spent our youth in that country following incompetent leaders who couldn't fuck their way out of a paper-bag without writing a book about it and then giving themselves at least an Army Achievement Medal for it.\n\nIt doesn't matter how the General Officer Corps of the United States Armed Forces spins it. Until one of them steps on the chopping block and admits that they completely and entirely failed when they didn't throw their rank on the table in protest of Biden's hair-brained scheme to get a PR win, I have zero faith in any of them as leaders.", "view_count": "65085", "created": "1656658159", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/us-troops-at-hkia-watch-as-afghan-civilians-fall-from-aircraft", "geo": {"region": "Kabul", "city": "Kabul", "country": "Afghanistan"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/End_of_OEF.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["34.5553494", "69.207486"]], "id": "22b6073f-c86f-5126-8ef8-a29979d890dc", "event_date": {"month": "8", "day": "16", "year": "2021"}, "author": "walklightstepstrong", "title": "U.S. Troops at HKIA Watch as Afghan Civilians Fall From Aircraft"}, {"geo": {"region": "Idlib", "city": "Dadikh", "country": "Syria"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "180", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/jutmd79konq91/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "1280", "height": "720"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1664396090", "coords": [["35.7979305", "36.7307641"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/xqn3zv/clashes_between_tahrir_alsham_fighters_and_syrian/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "jutmd79konq91", "event_date": {"month": "2", "day": "6", "year": "2020"}, "author": "Mohlabani4", "title": "Clashes between Tahrir al-Sham fighters and Syrian regime soldiers in the town of Dadikh, south of Idlib - 6 February 2020"}, {"selftext": "Footage from the 2nd Karabakh War (2020) between Armenia and Azerbaijan reportedly shows a BM-21 Grad rocket barrage targeting an already immobilized Azeri convoy.

He and several others dismount at 0:09 seconds, choosing to leave behind his flip-flops/slides/sandals/thongs (depending on your local vernacular). He advances alongside the other fighters to the entrance of a building clearly marked as a Myanmar Police Force station. They fire several rounds into the building. At 0:52, a fighter with what appears to be an underslung grenade launcher fires into the building, and again at 01:00. At 1:06 another grenadier, using a stand-alone launcher, takes his place. He fires, then is replaced by the original grenadier, who resumes firing with his rifle. At 01:23, the rifleman with the camera opens fire, firing several rounds. The squad then retreats to the Toyota at 01:33, after which at 01:44, the driver starts the vehicle and they depart.\n\n As is typical of this conflict, there's an interesting variety of weapon platforms at work here, in various states of age and repair.

In the footage provided, it shows one Palestinian pointing a handgun through the border walls and firing multiple shots.

Taking non-lethal measures, Israel forces dispersed the crowd of protesters using tear gas. \n\nLater that evening, Israel Defense Forces reportedly launched the aerial attack on the Hamas weapon storage and manufacturing positions, as a direct response to the shooting of their soldier.

This is the future of ground warfare in the Middle East.\n\nThe video you're looking at here isn't old by any means. It was recorded on February 2, 2022 in Afrin, Syria. The ATGM team was the group that released the video, and they're part of an organization that calls themselves the Afrin Liberation Forces. The exact make and model of the ATGM used is unknown, but most likely it's either the 9k111 Fagot or the 9M113 Konkurs as those are the two most commonly used ATGM systems throughout the Middle East currently.\n\nFor almost a decade now, I've been standing on the soap box here at Funker530 screaming about how ATGMs are going to be one of the largest threats on the ground in the Middle Eastern area of operations. The weapon systems have proven to be insanely effective for the rebel forces who frequent those areas, as they act as an easy-mode sniper rifle where the crew can guide the round into its target. We've seen hundreds of these videos released, and still not much has been done to prepare ground troops and regular combat vehicles to defeat the systems.\n\nFortunately for the Turkish Soldiers on the wrong-end of this video, the ATGM is not the greatest anti-personnel weapon. Had these guys been in a vehicle, there's no chance they would have had any warning that the shot was coming in on them. They also would have been in an enclosed space surrounded by armor, which is exactly they type of target this weapon system wants to make contact with. In the open, you'll have a couple seconds of warning if you're not looking in the incoming direction. If you're looking in the incoming direction, you could have as much as five to eight seconds to get out of the way.\n\nAccording to the Turks, neither of these guys were seriously wounded by this strike. That's simply because they happened to spot the weapon system coming in. Had they not, I suspect they might both be dead instead of just in the hospital.", "view_count": "17225", "created": "1643871051", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/two-turkish-soldiers-narrowly-avoid-atgm-shot", "geo": {"region": "Afrin District", "city": "Afrin", "country": "Syria"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/Turkish_Soliders_ATGM.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["36.5122781", "36.8653891"]], "id": "20fb7ffb-0618-5bde-b87d-3e8c527e7287", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": "2024"}, "author": "Funker530", "title": "Two Turkish Soldiers Dodge ATGM By Inches"}, {"geo": {"region": "Donetsk", "city": "Novomykhailivka", "country": "Ukraine"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "29", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/i6ey7223s70b1/DASH_240.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "422", "height": "240"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1684251900", "coords": [["47.8540723", "37.4868585"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/13j8t1a/a_ukrainian_t80_tank_of_the_79th_brigade_works_on/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "i6ey7223s70b1", "event_date": {"month": null, "day": null, "year": "2024"}, "author": "-Joker3d-", "title": "A Ukrainian T-80 tank of the 79th Brigade works on Russian positions near the village of Novomykhailivka, Donetsk region."}, {"selftext": "Video released to Twitter by Anti-Junta rebels in Myanmar captures an attack against an Army outpost near the village of Pakokku in the Magway region.\n\nNo further context exists for this specific piece of footage.

During the raid 31-year-old Wadee al-Houh, leader of the Nablus based Lion\u2019s Den terror group, was killed. Four other gunmen were also reported dead during the raid, which sparked intense clashes between Palestinians and IDF troops trying to exfiltrate at the conclusion of the raid.\n\nNablus has been the target of several IDF operations in the past few weeks as the Israelis have been specifically targeting the Lion's Den terror organization. The Lion's Den group is allegedly responsible for a string of attacks on military positions, settlements and other targets, which drew the attention of the IDF, law enforcement and counter-terror organizations throughout Israel.\n\nAnother 20 individuals were injured in the hours following the raid on the explosives factory which was destroyed by the IDF. \u201cDuring the operation, dozens of Palestinians burned tires and threw stones at troops,\u201d the army said, citing that there were several instances in which the IDF troops were forced to return fire on civilian gunmen who were firing on their vehicles. One of the injured individuals was shot while hurling a firebomb at an IDF armored vehicle.\n\nNo IDF troops were injured during the operation. The Palestinian Ministry of Health has identified the individuals killed during the operation as Hamdi Ramzy, 30, Ali Antar, 26, Hamdi Sharaf, 35, Wadee al-Houh, 31, and Mishaal Baghdadi, 27.", "view_count": "42293", "created": "1666680508", "source": "Funker530.com", "permalink": "https://funker530.com/video/idf-kills-terror-leader-in-nablus-during-daring-midnight-raid", "geo": {"region": "West Bank", "city": "Nablus", "country": "Palestine"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://images.funker530.com/images/media/images/Raid_Yjmmfj6.width-300.jpg", "coords": [["32.2226678", "35.2621461"]], "id": "5e36d4f6-4c6b-56ca-a91d-4a620097dddb", "event_date": {"year": "2023"}, "author": "johndoeuser", "title": "IDF Kills Terror Leader in Nablus During Daring Midnight Raid (New Player Test)"}, {"geo": {"region": "Kherson Oblast", "city": "Kaira", "country": "Ukraine"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "138", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/jcs0f8otapgb1/DASH_270.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "480", "height": "264"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1691419585", "coords": [["48.379433", "31.16558"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/15kmrx9/operators_of_the_perun_drone_from_the_73rd/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "jcs0f8otapgb1", "event_date": {"year": "2024"}, "author": "United_Feed_1980", "title": "Operators of the \"PERUN\" drone from the 73rd Maritime Center of Special Operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine discovered and destroyed a Russian tank and two armored vehicles at night in the area of the occupied village of Kaira, Kherson Region."}, {"geo": {"region": "Chechnya", "city": "Grozny", "country": "Russia"}, "reddit_video": {"duration": "222", "fallback_url": "https://v.redd.it/oj138480ajh51/DASH_240.mp4?source=fallback", "width": "320", "height": "240"}, "selftext": "", "created": "1597657453", "coords": [["43.31877009999999", "45.68652429999999"]], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/ibb3lt/russian_federal_forces_omon_in_heavy_combat_with/", "source": "CombatFootage", "id": "oj138480ajh51", "event_date": {"month": "3", "day": "7", "year": "1996"}, "author": "yomibuto", "title": "Russian federal forces ( OMON ) in heavy combat with Ickerian rebels, probably at streets of Groznyj.

Rapid Security Forces, who are known by their acronym as the RSF, claimed that they have stormed the international airport, presidential palace, and several smaller military installations inside of the city.

The Sudanese military has denied all claims that the RSF is in control of key terrain inside of the capital city.\n\nThe United States and United Kingdom embassies located in Khartoum have ordered all personnel to shelter in place inside of their embassies. They have also put out calls to citizens in Sudan to shelter in place where they are as well as violence is erupting throughout the city.

In 2019, there was a joint coup between the Sudanese Military and the Rapid Security Forces.
